/// This view is utilised by the `CollectionView` in order to handle the
/// creation of new attributes that are added to a collection attribute.
/// The behaviour of this view changes depending on the type of the attribute
/// within the collection. If the type of the attribute within the collection is
/// a `LineAttributeType`, then the view will display an `AttributeView` that 
/// allows the user to edit the new attribute. However, if the type of the
/// attribute within the collection is a `BlockAttributeType`, then the view
/// displays an "AddItem" button that when pressed will display a sheet that
/// contains a `ChangeItemView` for creating the new attribute.
